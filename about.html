                    I grew up in a small town called Lone Jack, Missouri. After graduating from Lone Jack High School, I attended the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona for a Bachelor of Science in Advancing Computer Science.
                    <br><br>
                    During my time at UAT, I was able to gain experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, C#, and React Native. I also have experience with game engines such as Unreal Engine 4, Unity, and Construct.
                    <br><br>
                    After graduating with my degree, I ended up staying in Phoenix, hoping to find new opportunities in all directions. I am currently looking for a new role that would help me grow as a developer while utilizing the skills I acquired in college.

                    During my free time, I tend to play video games such as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I enjoy a good movie or show as well, some of my favorites movies being the Lord of the Rings trilogy or recently the new Marvel movie, Thunderbolts. I tend to watch a lot of anime as well, my current favorite being Jujutsu Kaisen. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some of my other hobbies include hiking around Arizona and baking. I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, especially creating my own worldbuilding and campaigns. 
                    <br><br>
                    While I am doing any of these activities, I am likely jamming out to some tunes. I enjoy a variety of rock, alternative, and metal music, but I've been known to dabble in the occasional <br> j-pop every now and then.
