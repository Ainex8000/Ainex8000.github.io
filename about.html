                    I graduated from the high school there. Currently I am attending the University of Advancing
                    Technology as a Honors student pursuing a degree in Advancing Computer Science. When I am
                    not working on any assignments or projects, I can be found playing video games or watching
                    anime. Whatever I am doing, I am very likely listening to music as I am always listening to music.
                    Lately I have been looking into gourmet marshmallows as I have quite the sweet tooth.
                    I am a big dog lover and have three little puppies of my own.
